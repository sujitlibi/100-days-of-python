# Look at the code in the code editor.
# There are errors on all 5 lines of code.
# Fix the code so that it runs without errors.
#
# Exercise:
#
# Fix the code below ðŸ‘‡
#
# print(Notes from Day 1")
#  print("The print statement is used to output strings")
# print("Strings are strings of characters"
# priint("String Concatenation is done with the + sign")
# print(("New lines can be created with a \ and the letter n")
#
# Hint:
#
# Make sure you don't change any of the strings.
# The tests will look for an exact match to pass your code.
# If in doubt, you can always reset the code to the starting
# values by click on the refresh button on the top right of
# the code editor.

# Solution:
print("Notes from Day 1")
print("The print statement is used to output strings")
print("Strings are strings of characters")
print("String Concatenation is done with the + sign")
print("New lines can be created with a \ and the letter n")

# Solution Explanation:

# line 1:
# print(Notes from Day 1")
# Missing starting double quote. Should be:
# print("Notes from Day 1")
#
# line 2:
#  print("The print statement is used to output strings")
# Has an extra space before the start of the line. Should be:
# print("The print statement is used to output strings")
#
# line 3:
# print("Strings are strings of characters"
# Missing the closing parenthesis. Should be:
# print("Strings are strings of characters")
#
# line 4:
# priint("String Concatenation is done with the + sign")
# Typo in the command "priint" instead of "print". Should be:
# print("String Concatenation is done with the + sign")
#
# line 5:
# print(("New lines can be created with a \ and the letter n")
# Extra opening parenthesis. Should be:
# print("New lines can be created with a \ and the letter n")
#
# Full solution:
#
# print("Notes from Day 1")
# print("The print statement is used to output strings")
# print("Strings are strings of characters")
# print("String Concatenation is done with the + sign")
# print("New lines can be created with a \ and the letter n")

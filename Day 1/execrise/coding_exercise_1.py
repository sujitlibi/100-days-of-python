# Write a program that uses print statements to print the following recipe into the Output console.
# The text to print is already there, you just need to make it into code.
# Your code should print all five lines exactly the same as the example output below.
# Make sure that you don't change any of these existing text as everything,
# punctuation and casing all need to match!

# Exercise:
# 1. Mix 500g of Flour, 10g Yeast and 300ml Water in a bowl.
# 2. Knead the dough for 10 minutes.
# 3. Add 3g of Salt.
# 4. Leave to rise for 2 hours.
# 5. Bake at 200 degrees C for 30 minutes.

# Hint:
# The output in your program should match the example output shown above exactly,
# character for character, even spaces and symbols should be identical,
# otherwise the tests won't pass!

# Solution
print("1. Mix 500g of Flour, 10g Yeast and 300ml Water in a bowl.")
print("2. Knead the dough for 10 minutes.")
print("3. Add 3g of Salt.")
print("4. Leave to rise for 2 hours.")
print("5. Bake at 200 degrees C for 30 minutes.")


# Solution Explanation

# We just need to add the keyword print in front of all the lines we want to print.
# In addition, the print statement needs a set of parentheses () to enclose what should be printed.
# Finally, we also need some double quotes "text to print" around the text we want printed.
# So to solve this you need to add:
#
# print("
# in front of each line.
# Then add:
# ")
#
# at the end of each line.
#
# Without changing anything in between.
# This is the final solution code:
#
# print("1. Mix 500g of Flour, 10g Yeast and 300ml Water in a bowl.")
# print("2. Knead the dough for 10 minutes.")
# print("3. Add 3g of Salt.")
# print("4. Leave to rise for 2 hours.")
# print("5. Bake at 200 degrees C for 30 minutes.")
#
# If you had any issues and your code is not passing,
# try resetting the exercise using the rewind button at
# the top right of the editor to the restart and trying again.
# Most often, students make changes to the original text
# and change something and that's why the tests don't pass.

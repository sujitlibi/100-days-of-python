# Instruction:
#
# IndexError Handling
# Issue
# We've got some buggy code. Try running the code. The code will crash and give you an IndexError.
# This is because we're looking through the list of fruits for an index that is out of range.
#
# Objective
# Use what you've learnt about exception handling to prevent the program from crashing.
# If the user enters something that is out of range just print a default output of "Fruit pie".
#
# IMPORTANT: The exception handling should NOT allow each fruit to be printed when there is an exception.
# e.g. it should not print out Apple pie, Pear pie and Orange pie, when there is an exception it should
# only print "Fruit pie".

# Solution:
fruits = ["Apple", "Pear", "Orange"]

# Catch the exception and make sure the code runs without crashing.

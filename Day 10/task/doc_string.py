# You can use docstrings to write
# multiline comments that document your code.
#
# Syntax
# Just enclose your text inside a pair of three double quotes.
#
# e.g.
#
# """
# My
# Multiline
# Comment
# """
#
# Documenting Functions
# A neat feature of docstrings is you can use it
# just below the definition of a function and that
# text will be displayed when you hover over a function call.
# It's a good way to remind yourself what a self-created function does.
#
# e.g.
#
# def my_function(num):
#     """Multiplies a number by itself."""
#     return num * num

# Functions terminate at the return keyword.
# If you write code below the return statement that code will not be executed.
#
# However, you can have multiple return statements in one function.
# So how does that work?
#
# Conditional Returns
# When we have control flow,
# as in the code will behave differently
# (go down different execution paths) depending on certain
# conditional checks, we can end up with multiple endings (returns).
#
# e.g.
# def canBuyAlcohol(age):
#     if age >= 18:
#         return True
#     else:
#         return False
#
# Empty Returns
# You can also write return without anything after wards,
# and this just tells the function to exit.
#
# e.g.
# def canBuyAlcohol(age):
#     # If the data type of the age input is not a int, then exit.
#     if type(age) != int:
#         return
#
#     if age >= 18:
#         return True
#     else:
#         return False

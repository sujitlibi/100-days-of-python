# You can combine different conditions using logical operators.
#
# A and B #Both conditions need to be true
# C or D #Only one condition needs to be true
# not E #The condition must be false
#
# PAUSE 1 - Age 45 to 55 Modifier
# Update the code so that people age 45 to 55 (inclusive of both ages) ride for free.
# Use logical operators to check that the age is greater than 45, and it's also less than 55.
#
# NOTE: The warning for simplification is just a suggestion.
# You can consider it and chose it, or you can ignore it.
# In this lesson I wanted to show you and, or and not logical operators.
# So I recommend keeping the original code in case you come back to this lesson for review.

# ðŸ’ª This exercise is HARD ðŸ’ª
# Take a look inside file1.txt and file2.txt. They each contain a bunch of numbers, each number on a new line.
# You are going to create a list called result which contains the numbers that are common in both files.
#
# e.g. if file1.txt contained:
# 1
# 2
# 3
#
# and file2.txt contained:
# 2
# 3
# 4
#
# result = [2, 3]
#
# IMPORTANT:  The output should be a list of integers and not strings!
# Try to use List Comprehension instead of a Loop.

# Solution:
with open("file1.txt") as file1:
    list_of_string_1 = file1.readlines()

with open("file2.txt") as file2:
    list_of_string_2 = file2.readlines()

list_of_num_1 = [int(stg.strip('\n')) for stg in list_of_string_1]
list_of_num_2 = [int(stg.strip('\n')) for stg in list_of_string_2]

result = [num for num in list_of_num_1 if num in list_of_num_2]

print(result)

# Angela Solution:

# with open("file1.txt") as file1:
#     list1 = file1.readlines()
#
# with open("file2.txt") as file2:
#     list2 = file2.readlines()
#
# result = [int(num) for num in list1 if num in list2]
#
# print(result)

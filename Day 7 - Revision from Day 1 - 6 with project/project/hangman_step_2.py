# TODO-1
# Create an empty String called placeholder.
# For each letter in the chosen_word, add a _ to placeholder.
# So if the chosen_word was "apple", placeholder should be _ _ _ _ _ with 5 "_" representing each letter to guess.
# Print out hint.
#  Hint 1
# Remember you can use the range() function inside a loop to carry out an action for a particular number of times.

# TODO-2
# Create an empty string called "display".
# Loop through each letter in the chosen_word
# If the letter at that position matches guess then reveal that letter in the display at that position.
# e.g. If the user guessed "p" and the chosen word was "apple", then display should be _ p p _ _.
# Print display and you should see the guessed letter in the correct position.
# But every letter that is not a match is represented with a "_".
#  Hint 2
# Remember that the for loop will go through each letter in the chosen_word in order.
# You can use that fact to create a new string, appending the letter or an "_".

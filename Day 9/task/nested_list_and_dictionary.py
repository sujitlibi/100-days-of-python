# You can mix and match various data types to achieve your desired structure.
#
# Nesting a List inside a Dictionary
# Instead of a String value assigned to a key, we can replace it with a List.
# You can nest a List in a Dictionary like this:
#
# my_dictionary = {
#     key1: [List],
#     key2: Value,
# }
# PAUSE 1
# See if you can figure out how to print out "Lille" from the nested List called travel_log.
#
travel_log = {
    "France": ["Paris", "Lille", "Dijon"],
    "Germany": ["Stuttgart", "Berlin"],
}

print(travel_log["France"][1])
#
# Nesting Lists inside other Lists
# We've previously seen Nested Lists:
#
nested_list = ["A", "B", ["C", "D"]]
print(nested_list[2][1])
# PAUSE 2
# Do you remember how to get items that are nested deeply in a list?
# Try to print "D" from the list nested_list.
#
# Nesting a Dictionary inside a Dictionary
# You can also nest a dictionary in a dictionary:
#
# my_dictionary = {
#     key1: Value,
#     key2: {Key: Value, Key: Value},
# }
# PAUSE 3
# Figure out how to print out "Stuttgart" from the following list:
#
travel_log = {
  "France": {
    "cities_visited": ["Paris", "Lille", "Dijon"],
    "total_visits": 12
   },
  "Germany": {
    "cities_visited": ["Berlin", "Hamburg", "Stuttgart"],
    "total_visits": 5
   },
}

print(travel_log["Germany"]["cities_visited"][2])
